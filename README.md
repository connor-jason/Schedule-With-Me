# 🗓️ Schedule With Connor 🕒

## 👋 Introduction:
Welcome to **Schedule With Connor**, a web-based tool that makes scheduling hangouts easier! Whether it's a casual trip to Target or Starbucks, this app helps friends suggest a time and activity for meetups. With the option to confirm or reschedule, organizing get-togethers has never been simpler.

This project marks my first real dive into TypeScript. Though it has been challenging, it's been a great way to sharpen my skills in the language.

You can check out the app live at [https://schedule-with-connor.web.app](https://schedule-with-connor.web.app), hosted on Firebase!

## 📦 Tech Stack:
- **React.js**: for building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: for type-safe development
- **EmailJS**: for handling email notifications
- **HTML/CSS**: for structure and styling

## 👩🏽‍🍳 Features:
- Custom hand-drawn illustrations created using iPad and Apple Pencil
- Form for users to input their name, select an activity, and propose a meetup time
- Step-by-step process with visual feedback throughout
- Automatic email notifications upon confirmation
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices

## 💡 Process:
1. Set up the React environment and integrated TypeScript for better type management.
2. Created hand-drawn illustrations using Notability and an Apple Pencil.
3. Integrated EmailJS for email notifications when a meetup is scheduled.
4. Developed a multi-step form guiding users through the process of selecting an activity and proposing a time.
5. Managed form state and user inputs for smooth step transitions.
6. Implemented responsive design for an optimal experience across devices.

## 📚 What I Learned:
- **TypeScript:** Diving into TypeScript was a key learning experience, helping me become more comfortable with type declarations and type safety.
- **EmailJS:** My first time integrating email automation into a project, which made communication more efficient.
- **State Management in React:** Managing form state and handling multi-step transitions improved my understanding of React's hooks and state transitions.

## 🚀 Future Improvements:
- **Additional Activities:** Expand the list of predefined activities and add an option to suggest custom ones.
- **User Authentication:** Allow friends to create accounts for tracking and managing their meetup requests.
- **Calendar Integration:** Integrate with Google Calendar or Outlook for seamless scheduling.
