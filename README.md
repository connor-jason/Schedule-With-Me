# 🗓️ Schedule With Connor 🕒

## 👋 Intro:
This project is a web-based scheduling tool where friends can set up a time to meet with me for casual events like going to Target, Starbucks, or other common outings. The tool simplifies organizing hangouts by allowing people to suggest a time and activity, and then I can confirm or reschedule.

This project was my real introduction to TypeScript, and though I found it challenging, it's helping me improve my understanding of the language as I continue working with it.

## 📦 Tech Stack:
- **React.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **EmailJS**
- **HTML/CSS**

## 👩🏽‍🍳 Features:
- Form to input name, select an activity, and propose a time for a meetup.
- Step-by-step process with visual feedback.
- Automatically sends an email when a meetup is confirmed.
- Responsive design to work on both desktop and mobile.
  
## 💭 Process:
- The project began with setting up a React environment, integrating TypeScript to manage types and improve code structure.
- Implemented EmailJS for sending email notifications once an event is scheduled.
- Created a multi-step form to guide users through entering their name, choosing an activity, and selecting a time.
- Managed state for the form and user inputs, ensuring smooth transitions between steps.
- Finalized with CSS for a responsive and user-friendly layout.

## 📚 What I Learned:
- **TypeScript:** This project pushed me to get comfortable with TypeScript, especially handling type declarations and ensuring type safety across the app.
- **EmailJS:** First time integrating email functionality within a project, which was a great experience for automating communication.
- **State Management:** Managing multiple steps with state in React was a learning curve, but it improved my understanding of state transitions and hooks.

## ✨ Improvements:
- **More Activities:** Add more predefined activities and the ability to suggest custom activities.
- **Authentication:** Optionally require login for friends to track and manage their requests.
- **Calendar Integration:** Integrate with Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar for automatic scheduling.
